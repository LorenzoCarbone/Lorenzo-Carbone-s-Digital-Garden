This second species is known as Homo habilis. The title of Homo is one it does not clearly deserve since, far from being fully human, it retained its apelike body form and still used the trees as a refuge. But it possessed a striking new adaptation. The australopithecines had lived for 2.5 million years with brains scarcely bigger than a chimp’s, but with habilis the brain at last started to expand. Chimpanzees’ brains have a volume of 400 cubic centimeters, compared with the 1,400 ccs of the average modern human brain. 8 The australopithecine brain size ranged from 400 to 500 ccs. The brain volume of the known habilis skulls ranges from 600 to nearly 800 ccs.
