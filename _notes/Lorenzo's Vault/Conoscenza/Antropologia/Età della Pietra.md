Divided into three periods: [[Paleolitico]] (or Old Stone Age), [[Neolitico|Mesolitich]] (or Middle Stone Age), and [[Neolitico|Neolithic]] (or New Stone Age), this era is marked by the use of tools by our early human ancestors (who evolved around 300,000 B.C.) and the eventual transformation from a culture of hunting and gathering to farming and food production. During this era, early humans shared the planet with a number of now-extinct hominin relatives, including [[Neanderthals]] and Denisovans.
